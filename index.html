    <p><img src="./images/muruku.webp" alt="Muruku Logo" width="100px" height="100px" align="left"> Well, snack time is definitely something we all look forward to. <br>
        There's nothing quite like the joy of munching on crispy, spicy, cheesy and flavourful treats, 
        and if these dishes are home-made, it's all the more better. 
   </p>
   <p>
    Indians love their savory treats, and almost every household has their own specialties that they prepare for festivals or special occasions. <br>
    I love making cashew-studded pakorasâ€”they have to be eaten as soon as they're done, <br>
    indecently hot with steam rising as you break them into bite-sized pieces.

        I also love my mother's golden paniyarams, served with fresh coconut chutney or hot sambar for dunking. <br>
        But for those who would rather eat than cook, <br> sweet shops and restaurants all across South India consistently serve a variety of savory options.
